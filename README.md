# Real-Time Search

## Description

This is a quick demo of the real-time search capabilites of [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html). Built upon [@martinaglv](http://jsfiddle.net/user/martinaglv/fiddles/)'s [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/martinaglv/3N6D3/light/).

~~Using Spotify's [Charts API](http://charts.spotify.com/docs), this demo lists the most globally streamed tracks for today.~~
Spotify's [Charts API](http://charts.spotify.com/docs) seems to be discontinued and as a result, the list includes the most streamed tracks as of March 23, 2015.
